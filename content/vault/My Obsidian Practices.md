# My Obsidian Practices

## My Categories
My post will be divided in 3 categories
- Knowledge: Factual and learnings of a certain topic
- Reflection: Personal progress or reflection (90% original content)
- Exploration: Gather list of external content(90% external content)
- Blog: Mix of reflection and collection


## My Tags
To tag or not to tag, oftentime I found myself tagged a note that is way too specific. Generic term is preferred, especially those that I will forsee to occur more than once.

- Prefer lowercase if possible unless it's a product and brand
- Prefer single word text, keep spacing if more than one phrase
