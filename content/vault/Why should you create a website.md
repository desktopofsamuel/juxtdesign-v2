Have you been relying on social media to promote your content? How did you cope with the uprising of new platforms?

Discussion of decentralising the web has been going on for a while. Creating your own website is one step away from big tech companies, and most importantly owning your content. (Even though you probably still hosting on their server)

Content with an audience will be rewarded by a less biased system called search engine. Optimising your content to be discovered is some work but it’s still better than personalised recommendations on your social feeds.

I believe if you had your niche, audience would find their way to your website (FOR FREE) Hobbyist website are highly underrated and here’s a list of my favourite hobbyist websites

World wide web is more than just online stores, app landing pages and social media. Try create one today!

If you have some content, try to think what else could you offer to your audience. What would they really need to get started, instead of copying pasting content from your social media to the website. The best of websites are that it could be flexible as you want.

- Calculator: Anything your project can help calculate? Any special formula that you know can quickly help people visualise (E.g. How Much Does a Website Cost in 2022?)
- Wiki / Knowledge Base: If you have extensive domain knowledge, you should definitely consider creating a library or a series of blog articles guiding new audience to get started
- Online courses: Creating a online course be too much effort, what about designing a curriculum, a list of things people should know to get started
