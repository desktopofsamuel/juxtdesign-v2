## Where can I download it?

[View file here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/979571292056443766) or search "Keystroke" on Figma Community or click

Remember to use scale ("K" key" to resize since borders are outlined already! Let me know what you think and how would you apply it to your design using #MadeByJUXT
