Sparkline is a tiny chart to visualise trends of a series of data values. After The Flood created Sparks font to generate sparkline chart using a line of text, no Excel or any design software is required. Therefore you can use it anywhere, like Powerpoint, website or basically anywhere you can think of.

## How does that work?

Sparks used OpenTypeâ€™s context alternative feature to create a dot that is proportionate to the values that you typed in. For details can be found from their Github. Simply use `{}` to contain your values and `,` to separate your values. Mind that you should be using integers from 0 to 100.

## How can I customise?

There are 3 chart types that you can choose from Sparks - Bar, Dot, and Dotline. Each of them has 5 variations in different widths.

## How to download?

The official website is down already, but you can download the font from [their Github page](https://github.com/aftertheflood/sparks).
