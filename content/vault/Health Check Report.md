How would you design a body check report? Last month, i received a physical copy of my body check result. Embracing “product designer” mindset had me rethink on the experience of body check. 

There could be a lot of thinking behind the design of a health check report. First question most people want to know is "Am I normal or not?”. It’s important to let user know the numbers but at the same time the range they fell. How would you present the range of warning & danger? Will you use color? Has accessibility been considered. Moreover, what if there’s business cost to concern as printing in color will be much more expensive than black & white, will you able to come up with single color option?

Guess which design is the one I received and which is the best alternative from your point of view!
