## How do you save your inspirations?

Recently I discovered Raindrop.io, a bookmark manager developed with designers in mind.

There are multi-purpose views that you can set for each collection, Like List, Headlines Grid, Moodboard.

Of course, you can tag bookmarks and put them in different collections (folder). Thumbnail can be uploaded manually if crawling does not work. There's also auto-suggestion to tag base on page metadata.

It's impressive that the app has extensive browsers support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge)and mobile app available. However, features on app are quite limited at current stage.
