The first tip from [@juxtdesign](https://instagram.com/juxtdesignco) is Accessibility ‚úåÔ∏è ! Accessibility matters because making your site accessible meaning even more people (more than 1 billion disabled people in the world üßë‚Äçü¶Øüßèüßë‚Äçü¶Ω) can easily access your site. It stands for diversity and inclusion for your company and there are guidelines for you to follow.

## Step 1: How to evaluate my site's accessibility?
