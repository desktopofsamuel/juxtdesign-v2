Microsoft announced the next version of Windows, Windows 11 with a major design revamp. Start Menu has redesigned with Live Tile removed. Widgets are back, similar to the news tab in last year update. Aesthetically speaking, it's reverting back to the glossy glass vibe in Windows Vista. There will also be a bunch quality of life updates to windows management, external monitor docking, touch capability and more.
