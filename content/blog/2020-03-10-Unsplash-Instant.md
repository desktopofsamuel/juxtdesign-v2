Recently I have reinstalled my computer. Previously, I used [Mustsee](http://mustsee.earth/) as my default Chrome new tab with amazing tourist spots around the world. Now I have switched to [Unsplash Instant](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unsplash-instant/pejkokffkapolfffcgbmdmhdelanoaih?hl=en) with the feature show previous viewed photos as well as direct download. Even on Firefox or other browsers without official extension, you can set [instant.unsplash.com](https://instant.unsplash.com/) as your home page for a similar experience.
