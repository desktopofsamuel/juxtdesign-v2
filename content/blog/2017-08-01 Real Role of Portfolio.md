What is the takeaway you want people to leave your portfolio website with?

> I couldn’t avoid stepping back and asking myself “but hey, what is the real role of a design portfolio in the first place?”. Until the people engaging in that discussion align on what a portfolio’s objectives are, they won’t have any fruitful conclusions coming out of it.
